# CodeClause_Alarm-Clock-with-GUI
In this code I have created a new window in which I have used Tkinter library as it helps in GUI.
Then added PIL also known as PILLOW to insert images.
Then made the UI for Hours , Minutes , SEconds and Period.
After that I have define the function for setting an alarm , stopping an alarm and also for the audio of the alarm
